# REST API using Postman and Node.js

This repository contains a sample REST API built with Node.js and provides a Postman collection to interact with the API. This README file will guide you through the setup, features, and usage of the project.

## Features

- **Sample REST API:** The project includes a basic REST API with endpoints for common CRUD operations.

- **Postman Collection:** A Postman collection is provided for easy testing and interaction with the API.

- **Node.js Backend:** The API is built using Node.js, a popular JavaScript runtime environment, and the Express.js framework for creating web applications.

## Installation and Setup

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/rest-api-postman-nodejs.git
   cd rest-api-postman-nodejs
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Environment Variables:**

   Create a `.env` file in the project root and configure any necessary environment variables, such as the API port and database connection details.

4. **Start the Server:**

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## Usage

1. **Testing with Postman:**

   - Import the provided Postman collection (found in the `postman` directory) into your Postman application.

   - Use the collection to send requests to the API endpoints. You can test GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE operations on the sample resources.

2. **API Endpoints:**

   - Sample endpoints include:
     - `GET /api/resource`: Retrieve a list of resources.
     - `GET /api/resource/:id`: Retrieve a specific resource.
     - `POST /api/resource`: Create a new resource.
     - `PUT /api/resource/:id`: Update an existing resource.
     - `DELETE /api/resource/:id`: Delete a resource.

## Customization

You can customize this project to meet your specific needs by:

- Adding more routes and endpoints.
- Implementing authentication and authorization.
- Integrating with a database (e.g., MongoDB, PostgreSQL, etc.).
- Extending the API functionality to suit your project requirements.
